# Churn-Analysis-Prediction
This project is an end-to-end telecom churn analysis and prediction using interactive dashboards and machine learning. Visualizes churn trends, identifies at-risk customers, and provides key insights for targeted retention strategies.

## Key Technologies Used

- *Python*
   - The primary language for data analysis, processing, and predictive modeling.

- *Jupyter Notebook*
  - Interactive environment for step-by-step exploration, documentation, and sharing workflows.

- *Pandas & Numpy*
   - Reliable libraries for data manipulation, cleaning, transformation, and fast numerical computations.

- *Matplotlib & Seaborn*
   - Tools for designing visualizations, charts, and graphical summaries essential for communicating churn trends.

- *Scikit-learn*
   - Machine learning framework for preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

- *Joblib*
   - Efficient model serialization: saves trained models to disk and loads them back for future predictions or deployment.

- *Openpyxl*
   - Library for reading and writing Excel (.xlsx) files, enabling direct integration with business data sources.
