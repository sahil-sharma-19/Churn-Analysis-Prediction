# Churn-Analysis-Prediction
This project is an end-to-end telecom churn analysis and prediction using interactive dashboards and machine learning. Visualizes churn trends, identifies at-risk customers, and provides key insights for targeted retention strategies.

## Key Technologies Used

- *Python* - The primary language for data analysis, processing, and predictive modeling.

- *Jupyter Notebook* - Interactive environment for step-by-step exploration, documentation, and sharing workflows.

- *Pandas & Numpy* - Reliable libraries for data manipulation, cleaning, transformation, and fast numerical computations.

- *Matplotlib & Seaborn* - Tools for designing visualizations, charts, and graphical summaries essential for communicating churn trends.

- *Scikit-learn* - Machine learning framework for preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

- *Joblib* - Efficient model serialization: saves trained models to disk and loads them back for future predictions or deployment.

- *Openpyxl* - Library for reading and writing Excel (.xlsx) files, enabling direct integration with business data sources.

- ## Data Source Information

 The sample dataset illustrated here has been synthesized for demonstration purposes in the Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction Dashboard. It is designed to closely simulate real-world telecom operations and typical customer records, including churn status, account history, payment details, service usage, and demographic information.

The structure and fields in this synthetic data are inspired by attributes commonly maintained in telecom and subscription management systems, such as:

Customer demographics (ID, age, gender, marital status)

Account and contract details (tenure, contract type, payment method)

Service information (internet type, phone service, value-added services)

Usage patterns and monthly charges

Churn tracking (churn status, category, and reason)

This sample data enables comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling of customer churn, mirroring challenges faced in real-world subscription industries. It supports exploration of factors influencing churn as well as the development of machine learning solutions for customer retention.
