# Churn-Analysis-Prediction
This project is an end-to-end telecom churn analysis and prediction using interactive dashboards and machine learning. Visualizes churn trends, identifies at-risk customers, and provides key insights for targeted retention strategies.

## Key Technologies Used
Python
The primary programming language for all analysis, modeling, and preprocessing tasks.

Jupyter Notebook
An interactive environment for data exploration, visualization, and sharing reproducible analysis workflows.

pandas & numpy
Core libraries for robust data manipulation, cleaning, transformation, and efficient numerical computations.

matplotlib & seaborn
Powerful tools for data visualization and graphical analysis—used to create understandable charts and visual summaries.

scikit-learn
Machine learning library for implementing algorithms, preprocessing data, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

joblib
Efficient model serialization: saves trained machine learning models to disk and loads them quickly for later use or deployment.

openpyxl
Excel file (.xlsx) I/O—enables reading and writing customer data directly from spreadsheets to Python, making business data integration seamless
